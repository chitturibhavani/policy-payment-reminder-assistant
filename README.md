# ðŸ§  GenAI Policy Payment Reminder Assistant

This is a prototype project for a **GenAI-powered automated policy payment reminder assistant**, built as part of an interview case study.

The assistant can:
- Remind customers about pending insurance policy payments.  
- Handle **Pay Now**, **Pay Later**, and **Not Interested** flows.  
- Demonstrate integration with mocked APIs (Payment, Confirmation, Policy Portal Update, Email, Scheduler).  

âš¡ The goal: **Show working prototype + approach**, not production-ready code.
